## About IS 448 
* _IS 448 - Markup and Scripting Languages_ covers the history, theory, and practice of markup languages and their associated scripting languages. 
* This course covers client-side web technology, such as **Javascript** and server-side web technology, such as **PHP**, markup languages, **XML**, and common databases used with web technology.

## About the project
* Students are expected to work in groups to develop a web application with real-life, practical
use. The project will be viewed from an entrepreneurial perspective, i.e., student teams will be
treated as start-up companies that are designing and developing an innovative idea! The web
application should be complex enough to incorporate forms, interaction with database, clientside
interaction with JavaScript and Ajax and server-side interaction with PHP.
* Project completion date: 12/10/2020

## My contributions
* For this project, I served as the _leader/project manager_ who led the team through all the phases of the software development. On top of that, I led the team in the testing effort to test the software for correctness and robustness.
* I was responsible for the **Manage Profile** use case, which enables the user to change their profile information. 
  * Input will be the new credentials such as Name, Username, or Password into a text box form. A PHP script will update the Accounts table in the MySQL database based on the new input that the user provided.
* More specifically, I worked on the following files:
  * [general.php](https://github.com/miguel-arana/is448-project/blob/main/general.php)
  * [general.js](https://github.com/miguel-arana/is448-project/blob/main/general.js)
